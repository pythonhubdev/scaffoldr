# Scaffoldr

> Previously this package was known as `faag-cli` now renamed to `scaffoldr`.

Scaffoldr is a tool designed to help developers quickly set up and manage project structures, configurations, and
boilerplate code. It automates the initial setup process, allowing developers to focus on writing code rather than
spending time on repetitive tasks. This project aims to support various frameworks of python like FastAPI, Flask,
Litestar, Blacksheep, etc.
